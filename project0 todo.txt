DONE withdraw() needs customer_id(search),account type (user input), account_number(search) and amount to withdraw (user input), balance(search)

So i need to search for account number: by account type and using customer id.

I need to search for balance using: account number

Balance done

DONE deposit() needs customer_id,account type, account_number and amount to deposit


DONE transactionlogging()

Done....????

some internal search layer that searches and displays account info for user. so user inputs are only for their own accounts.

QuickFind class. Find balance. Acc numbers. Id's. etcc. finding any info i need quickly so methods can work.


or just use models.... getter setter...


DONE transfer()



extendedfeautres()

Email gets customer_id... Customer_id can retrieve just about anything else.
